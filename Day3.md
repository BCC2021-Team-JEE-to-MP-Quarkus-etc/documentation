# Implement quick-start with wildfly 25

# Persistence PoC with quarkus

## Debugging:
- start quarkus as usual: `mvn quarkus:dev`
- In IntelliJ Menubar select: `Run/Attach to Process...` and choose the quarkus process from the list of the dialog
- Set breakpoints in the code and invoke a REST endpoint in the browser
- IntelliJ should stop at the breakpoint

## Persistence with standard JPA entities:

In addition to the PanacheEntity approach
we created a standard JPA entity JpaBook
